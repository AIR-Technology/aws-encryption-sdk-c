/**
 * Creates a new multi-keyring. This keyring allows you to combine keyrings into
 * a single keyring. When used for encryption, the resulting document can be 
 * decrypted by any of the included keyrings; when used for decryption, the multi-
 * keyring will attempt to decrypt using each of the included keyrings.
 *
 * Initially the multi keyring has no included keyrings. In this state, generate,
 * encrypt, and decrypt calls will trivially succeed without actually generating,
 * encrypting, or decrypting data keys. Call aws_cryptosdk_multi_mkp_add
 * to add other keyrings to a multi-keyring.
 *
 * Destroying this keyring will NOT destroy the keyrings that were added to it. Be
 * sure to call the destructors on those keyrings too in order to avoid memory leaks.
 *
 * On generate data key calls, this will generate the data key with the first child
 * keyring that was added, and it will fail immediately if the generation of the data
 * key fails. It will then attempt to encrypt the same data key with each other child
 * keyring that was added. It will proceed through the entire list, even if it
 * encounters errors. On an error from any child keyring, AWS_OP_ERR will be returned,
 * and it is expected that the failing child keyring will set an error code. If more
 * than one child keyring fails, error codes will be overwritten by the last failure.
 *
 * If a child keyring experiences an error on encrypt data key, any data keys that were
 * generated and encrypted from other child keyrings will *still* be returned in the
 * encryption materials object, giving the caller the option to override
 * the error and proceed with encrypting the message. This is a dangerous option,
 * because the message may end up not being readable to all intended recipients.
 * Note that our pre-made default and caching CMMs will NOT proceed with encryption if
 * this happens and will destroy the generated encryption materials.
 *
 * Encrypt data key calls are similar. The call will *always* attempt to encrypt the
 * data key with each child keyring, even if some fail. Errors from child keyrings are
 * handled the same way as encrypt data key errors within the generate data key call.
 * However, this function is unlikely to be called on a multi-keyring, unless it is
 * added to another multi-keyring.
 *
 * Decrypt data key will attempt to decrypt one of the EDKs with each child keyring
 * until it succeeds. Errors from child keyrings will not stop it from proceeding to
 * others. If it succeeds in decrypting an EDK, it will return AWS_OP_SUCCESS, even
 * if one or more of the child keyrings failed. If it does not succeed in decrypting
 * an EDK, it will return AWS_OP_SUCCESS if there were no errors, and AWS_OP_ERR if
 * there were errors. As with all decrypt data key calls, check decryption materials
 * unencrypted_data_key.buffer to see whether an EDK was decrypted.
