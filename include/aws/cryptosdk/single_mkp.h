/**
 * A Master Key Provider (MKP) that has a single Master Key (MK). Use after
 * instantiating a MK, as a connector between the MK and CMM when there are no other
 * MKs and all data key generation/encryption/decryption should be done by only this MK.
 *
 * This MKP's get_master_keys method always appends the pointer to the master key
 * with which it was initialized to the list of master keys. The only way it can
 * fail is if there is a problem with the array list itself.
 *
 * This MKP's decrypt_data_key method simply delegates the call to the decrypt_data_key
 * method of its MK.
 *
 * On success allocates a MKP and returns its address. Be sure to deallocate it later
 * by caling aws_cryptosdk_mkp_destroy on the MKP pointer returned by this function.
 *
 * On failure returns NULL and sets and internal AWS error code.
